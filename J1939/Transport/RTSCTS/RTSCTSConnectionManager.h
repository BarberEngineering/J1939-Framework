 * Specific communication â€“ Connection Mode Data Transfer:
 * With this protocol the sender establishes a connection to the receiver.
 * The receiver has the option of controlling and influencing the flow control of the individual data packets.
 * Both the receiver and sender can abort the connection (e.g. in case of errors).
 * The Connection Mode Data Transfer protocol is not subject to any time limitation.
 * All nodes potentially exchange their data with one another at their maximum possible speed.
